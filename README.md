 # Staticrypt

 The name is an abbreviation of "Static Encryption" - a Rust proc macro libary to encrypt text
 literals or binary data using [`Aes256Gcm`].

 The crate is intended to be a successor to the [`litcrypt`](https://docs.rs/litcrypt/latest/litcrypt/),
 and expand on the overall idea of the library.

 Like litcrypt, staticrypt works by encrypting the given data at compile time. In its place, it
 leaves the encrypted contents and a 96 bit nonce (unique for every encrypted item), protecting
 your data from static analysis tools.

 In contrast to to litcrypt's `lc`, staticrypt's [`sc`] supports all valid Rust string literals,
 including those with escape sequences, unicode characters, etc.

 To initialize staticrypt in a crate, the [`use_staticrypt`] macro needs to be called first. See
 its doc page for more info on initial setup.

 ## Example

 ```rust
 use staticrypt::*;

 // Needs to be present at the root of the crate.
 use_staticrypt!();

 fn main() {
     // Protect sensitive information from static analysis / tampering
     println!("The meaning of life is {}", sc!("42"));
 }
 ```

 Everything inside the [`sc`] macro will be encrypted at compile time. You can verify that none
 of the strings are present in cleartext using something like `strings`:

 ```shell
 strings target/debug/my_app | grep 42
 ```

 If the output is blank / does not contain the string you are looking for, then your app is safe
 from static analysis tools.

 ## DISCLAIMER

 Although using tools like staticrypt makes it very difficult for attackers to view or alter
 your data, it does _not_ make it impossible. You should develop your programs with the
 assumption that a sufficiently determined attacker will be able to reverse engineer your
 encryption and gain access to any data present in your binary, so it is **highly discouraged** to
 use this crate to embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, private keys etc. in your
 application.
